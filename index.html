  <h6>HISTORY...</h6>
  <P>Most hip hop fans know all about the latest album dropped, the latest gossip between rappers, or the newest video vixen to get mainstream status. They can also tell you volumes about urban streetwear, new sneaker releases, and the hottest clubs to go
    to in the city. But, from what I've seen, it takes a real OG to name off what old school hip hop fans coined the Four Elements of Hip Hop. The fact is that you don't really hear much about them in rap lyrics these days - and as a result, some even
    are wondering if they've been played out. It was Afrika Bambaataa and Zulu Nation that first actually spoke about the four pillars of hip hop culture as a whole. As many hip hop heads can tell you, that means it's really old school - to the point
    that it predates Snoop Dogg's celebrity status.</p>
    <p> Even though people don't rap about them in today's mixes, the truth is that there's no doubt that these four elements are just as relevant in modern hip hop as they were back in the early 90s. DJing
    Yes, though there were electronic music groups out there before hip hop's advent, it'd be a boldfaced lie to not point out that the vast majority of electronica groups have hip hop to thank for some level of music technique. DJing, beatmaking, and
    turntablism was one of the founding pillars of hip hop </p>
